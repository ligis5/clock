Digital clock that shows hours, city you are in, based on IP.(Sometimes it shows wrong location).
So you can just click on city and change it to what you want.
Ip/location I get using free API "https://ipapi.co/"
Then using "https://www.weatherapi.com/" I get weather forecast, this one requires API-KEY, easy sign up and you are good to go.
Has alarm clock, where wanted time is dialed in by holding left mouse button on number and draging it up or down, when you let go that number will be stored in localStorage.
Alarm sound will ring until minute passes, or "Stop" is pressed.
